        <h5>The Kaikoura earthquake on 14 November was a wake-up call for Wellington. While science and history have told us to prepare for a big shake, there's no reminder quite as powerful as the real thing, says Mayor Justin Lester.</h5>
        <p>It could have been worse, of course, and our job now is to keep strengthening our city and communities so we can respond effectively and recover quickly if another one hits.</p>
        <p>We also want to make sure we're thinking about the other stresses - physical, social and economic - Wellington might face in the future. To do this, we're introducing the best local solutions with the support of leading thinkers from around the world.</p>
        <h5>Making our city safer</h5>
        <p>While buildings and infrastructure in the capital have generally been built tough, there's more we can do to keep people safe. Among the projects we're supporting this year is a joint fund with the Government to help Wellington building owners to secure unreinforced masonry on their properties.</p>
        <p>These Victorian and Edwardian buildings are precious and contribute hugely to the character of the city. In their existing condition, however, they present a serious hazard to people in the street. Falling masonry has been responsible for many earthquake-related deaths in New Zealand and overseas.</p>
